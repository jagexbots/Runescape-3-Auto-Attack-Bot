# Runescape 3 Auto Attack Bot

I was disgruntled when Jagex punked me out of my lead position at Jagex.

I have since worked hard to destroy everything they stand for, this bot is a very capable colour clicker.

It can silent attack enemies while the user is free to navigate UI's in-game, when the user wishes to use other applications it will pause and return operation when the mouse cursor hovers back over the Runescape window.

It is a very versatile bot, with few configurable parameters, although enough to be powerful.

If you desire to auto-collect drops I suggest setting the start scan radius to 1px.

Silent click is no more detectable than any other click method, the only thing that will get you caught using this bot is using it for too long periods in one succession.

If would like to set a new attack colour, hold Z and then tap V when over the target - or the auto click will click the target.

Mouseover text should be enabled for the basic entity auto click option, but for all else, silent click, auto-hunt, it doesn't matter. Obv the idea is to detect if you are pointing at an entity worth clicking, then it checks to see if the game created a "Mouseover text" tooltip. This is handy for auto alchemy, but for mining I would use silent click.
